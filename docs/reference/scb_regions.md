# Region Codes in the Central Bureau of Statistics ("Statistiska centralbyrån") in Sweden

This is a simple data set for matching region codes to the names of
territorial units in Sweden, at least recorded/cataloged by the Central
Bureau of Statistics in Sweden.

## Usage

``` r
scb_regions
```

## Format

A data frame with 312 observations on the following 2 variables.

- `region`:

  an intuitive name for a territorial unit/"region" in Sweden

- `region_code`:

  an alpha-numeric code coinciding with the territorial unit/"region"

## Details

Data were manually derived from first gathering everything the Central
Bureau of Statistics had to offer. Its intended use is alongside the
pxweb package. May it allow for more focused uses of the package without
having to rely on the interactive component to do all the heavy-lifting.
