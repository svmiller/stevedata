# The Datasaurus Dozen

An illustrative exercise in never trusting the summary statistics
without also visualizing them.

## Usage

``` r
Datasaurus
```

## Format

A data frame with 1,846 observations on the following 3 variables.

- `dataset`:

  the particular data set, one of 12

- `x`:

  a random variable

- `y`:

  another random variable

## Details

Data were created by Alberto Cairo to illustrate you should always
visualize your data beyond the summary statistics. These are 12 data
sets, in long form, each with a mean of `x` about 54.26, a mean of `y`
about 47.83. The standard deviation for `x` is about 16.76 and the
standard deviation of `y` is about 26.93. `x` and `y` will correlate
weakly, about -.06.
