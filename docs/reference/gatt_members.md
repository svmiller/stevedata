# The 128 Countries That Had Signed GATT by 1994

A data set on GATT membership.

## Usage

``` r
gatt_members
```

## Format

A data frame with 128 observations on the following 3 variables.

- `country`:

  a character vector for a country name

- `iso3c`:

  a three-character ISO code

- `date`:

  the date the country joined GATT

## Details

Data come from the World Trade Organization. Three-character ISO codes
should be used with some caution as they mostly match what these states
are now, if not what they were when they signed GATT (see: Benin,
Democratic Republic of Congo). The conspicuous exception here is
Yugoslavia, which has Yugoslavia's three-character ISO code of `YUG`
