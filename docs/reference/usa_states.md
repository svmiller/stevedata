# State Abbreviations, Names, and Regions/Divisions

A simple data set from `state.abb`, `state.name`, `state.region`, and
`state.division` (+ District of Columbia). I'd rather just have all
these in one place.

## Usage

``` r
usa_states
```

## Format

A data frame with 51 observations on the following 4 variables.

- `stateabb`:

  the state abbreviation

- `statename`:

  the state's name

- `region`:

  the state's Census region

- `division`:

  the state's Census division
