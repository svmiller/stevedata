Description: This is a collection of various kinds of data with broad uses for teaching. 
    My students, and academics like me who teach the same topics I teach, should find 
    this useful if their teaching workflow is also built around the R programming 
    language. The applications are multiple but mostly cluster on topics of statistical
    methodology, international relations, and political economy.
