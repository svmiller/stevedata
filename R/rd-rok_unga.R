#' @details
#'
#' Voeten et al's codebook cautions that their agreement variable is there for
#' comparison and should not be used for a serious analysis of dyadic foreign
#' policy similarity. The `agree` variable I calculate is based on *all* votes,
#' whereas (I think) Voeten et al. exclude amendments and votes on paragraphs.
#'
#' Cohen's (weighted) kappa is suggested by Haege (2011) for use measuring
#' dyadic foreign policy similarity. This measure is likewise calculated by me
#' for *all* votes. I forget how Haege (2011) does this for his calculations and
#' if he is excluding votes on amendments or paragraphs. Its interpretation
#' differs from how one might use the ideal point distance variable. This is a
#' chance-corrected correlation. Higher values indicate more similarity whereas
#' higher values in the ideal point distance variable communicate more dissimilarity.
#'
#' GDP per capita include some imputations by way of a semiparametric Bayesian
#' Gaussian copulas. This prominently concerns Venezuela. Data are otherwise
#' derived from the World Banks' open data.
#'
#' Xavier Marquez' "extended Unified Democracy Scores" approximate a normal
#' distribution with a standard deviation of 1. Invoking `pnorm()` on a particular
#' estimate provides a kind of probabilistic assessment of whether the observation
#' in question is a democracy. In both the Varieties of Democracy estimate and
#' the Marquez estimate, higher values = "more democracy". See also: the
#' \code{Lipset59} documentation in this same package.
#'
#' Capital-to-capital distance is calculated using the Vicenty method ("as the
#' crow flies"), and is done by way of a \pkg{peacesciencer} call and its
#' \code{add_capital_distance()} function. There are unusual cases where a capital
#' moved (i.e. Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nigeria). In those cases, the capital on Jan.
#' 1 of the given year is treated as the capital.
