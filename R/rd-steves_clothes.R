#' Steve's (Professional) Clothes, as of March 20, 2022
#'
#' I cobbled together this data set of the professional clothes
#'  (polos, long-sleeve dress shirts, pants) in my closet, largely for
#'  illustration on the origins of apparel in the U.S. for an intro lecture on trade.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 86 observations on the following 4 variables.
#' \describe{
#' \item{\code{type}}{Type of clothing}
#' \item{\code{brand}}{The brand of clothing (e.g. Apt. 9, Saddlebred)}
#' \item{\code{color}}{the color (and/or pattern) of the article of clothing}
#' \item{\code{origin}}{The country that produced the garment.}
#' }
#'
#' @details If you must know, I do most of my clothes shopping at major retailers
#' in the U.S. (mostly Belk, J.C. Penney, and Kohl's). If that's you as well, the
#' odds are good the distribution of my clothes will closely resemble yours.)
