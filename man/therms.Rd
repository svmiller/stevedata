\description{
A data set on thermometer ratings for Donald Trump and Barack Obama in 2020.
I use these data for in-class illustration of
central limit theorem. Basically: the sampling distribution of a
population is normal, even if the underlying population is decidedly
not.
}
\details{
The survey period was April 10-18, 2020 and was done entirely online.
Thermometer ratings are on a 0 to 100 scale, where higher values indicate
more "warmth".
