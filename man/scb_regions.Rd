\title{Region Codes in the Central Bureau of Statistics ("Statistiska centralbyr√•n") in Sweden}
\format{
A data frame with 312 observations on the following 2 variables.
\describe{
\item{\code{region}}{an intuitive name for a territorial unit/"region" in Sweden}
\item{\code{region_code}}{an alpha-numeric code coinciding with the territorial unit/"region"}
}
}
\usage{
scb_regions
}
\description{
This is a simple data set for matching region codes to the names of
 territorial units in Sweden, at least recorded/cataloged by the Central
 Bureau of Statistics in Sweden.
}
\details{
Data were manually derived from first gathering everything the Central Bureau
of Statistics had to offer. Its intended use is alongside the \pkg{pxweb}
package. May it allow for more focused uses of the package without having
to rely on the interactive component to do all the heavy-lifting.
