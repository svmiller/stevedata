\describe{
\item{\code{schoolid}}{a numeric vector that should be understood as categorical}
\item{\code{hispanic}}{a numeric vector for if the person is Hispanic}
\item{\code{college}}{a numeric vector for if the person went to college}
\item{\code{black}}{a numeric vector for if the person is black}
\item{\code{otherrace}}{a numeric vector for if the person is another race}

\description{
This should be a data set for a (partial?) replication of
Dee's (2004) article on the purported civics returns to education. I use
these data for in-class illustration about instrumental variable analyses.
}
\details{
I should note I acquired this data set in Mexico City sitting on a two-week program at IPSA-FLACSO Mexico Summer School in 2019. The sample size here (9,227) is about two thousand short of what Dee reports in his article. It'll do, though.
