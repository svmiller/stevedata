\item{\code{gdppc}}{a numeric vector for the per capita GDP in USD}

\item{\code{medexppc}}{a numeric vector for per capita medical care expenditure (in USD)}
}
}

\description{
These are the data in Newhouse's (1977) simple OLS model from 1977. In
his case, he's trying to explain medical care expenditures as a function of GDP
per capita for these countries. It's probably the easiest OLS model I can find
in print because Newhouse helpfully provides all the data in one simple table.
}
\details{
Table 1 in Newhouse (1977) is well-annotated with background information.
