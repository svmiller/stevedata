\description{
A data set on government spending in select rich countries as a function of
trade/GDP, financial openness, and the state-year-level engagement in trade
unions (among other things). The data offer a means to quasi-replicate
Garrett's (1998) argument about left-wing governments' ability to stem the
tide of globalization's effect on decreased government spending. Data also
draw inspiration from Rodrik (1998) and Garrett (2001).

\details{
The data are an unbalanced panel with assorted quirks during its
construction. Data missingness affecting Switzerland means it would only appear
in the panel starting in the mid-1990s. The Netherlands has some missing data
in the mid-1970s. Spain and Portugal appear at the start of the panel, though
the transition to democracy for both wouldn't start until 1974/1975. Union
density coverage is spotty for states like Greece and Portugal. The data also
have some obvious COVID weirdness for 2020. Use that to inform whatever case
or variable selection you would like to do. It may make sense to employ a
temporal domain of something like 1975 to 2015, or whatever.

The dependency ratio is defined as the population aged 0-14, or 65 and above,
divided over the "working-age" population of 15-64 (x 100).

Briefly: the government spending/GDP data come from the International
Monetary Fund. The trade/GDP data come from the World Bank's API, as do the
population, GDP per capita, and urbanization data (see their details). The
more convention union density data come from OECD/ICWSS. The financial
openness indicators come by way of the Chinn-Ito index. The engagement in
trade unions data are from the Varieties of Democracy project. The ordinal
measure of the trade union estimates communicate what percentag of the
population is active in independent trade unions. Values include 0)
virtually no one 1) a small share of the population (less than 5\%), 2) A
moderate share of the population (about 5 to 15\%). 3) A large share of
the population (about 16 \% to 25\%). 4) A very large share of the population
(about 26\% or more).
