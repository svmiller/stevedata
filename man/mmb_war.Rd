\description{
A simple data set on mutual military build-ups and war, useful for teaching
about a long-standing empirical debate in international relations by way of
basic tests (like a chi-square test).

\details{
The unit of analysis for these data are non-directed dyadic confrontations
for strategic rivals. Be mindful that confrontations start with the first
event of any kind. See Gibler and Miller (2024a, 2024b) for more about events
and confrontations. See Thompson et al. (2021) for more information about
strategic rivalries.

Mutual military build-ups (MMBs, for short) are a slightly more evasive label
I'm using for the more familiar "arms race." They are operationalized largely
from Gibler et al. (2005). Briefly: mutual military build-ups are any episode
in 1) a rivalry relationship where 2) each dyadic partner is increasing their
military expenditure \emph{or} personnel, 3) eight percent or more from the
previous year, 4) for at least three years where 5) historical evidence largely
corroborates a directionality in the mobilization of the kind we would
broadly conceptualize (a la Richardson, 1939).

The data I recreate here follow Gibler et al. (2005), but use newer
capabilities and rivalry data. I further employ some case exclusion rules
that would not otherwise be evident in a reading of Gibler et al. (2005).
First, I take some care to exclude cases where it is pretty clear that what
Gibler et al. (2005) call an arms race is more accurately just the mobilization
of the war itself. For example, their arms race #26 between China and Japan
occurs between 1940 and 1944, though the ongoing war between both comfortably
covers it. Related, I employ an admittedly ad hoc termination date to end when
we might comfortably note a war is ongoing (see: the various World War 1
arms races). Further, I often extend a year to an arms race if one side
started mobilizing first and the other side only started mobilizing the next
year and/or one side continued mobilizing for a year after the other stopped.
This is why, for example, I have an extra in the Spain-Morocco build-up in
the early 1970s (Spain mobilized through 1975). There were some cases where
I disagreed that something could be considered an arms race/mutual military
build-up by this metric. For example, the build-up observed between Somalia
and Ethiopia in the 1970s (their arms race #44) is an interesting case where
it's clear Ethiopia is mobilizing. However, the data suggest only one year
of mobilization for Somalia (1974). I remove those cases from my recreation.
