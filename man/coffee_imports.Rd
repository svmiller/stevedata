\title{Coffee Imports for Select Importing Countries}
\format{
A data frame with 4264 observations on the following 6 variables.
\describe{
\item{\code{country}}{a character vector for the country}
\item{\code{iso2c}}{a two-character vector of the country's ISO code}
\item{\code{member}}{a numeric vector indicating whether the importer is or is not a member of the International Coffee Organization}
\item{\code{year}}{a numeric vector for the year}
\item{\code{value}}{a numeric vector for the coffee imports for all select importing countries (in thousand 60-kg bags)}
\item{\code{pop}}{a numeric vector for the population size, in units of humans}
}

\description{
A simple panel on coffee imports for importing countries.

\details{
Coffee consumption data come from the International Coffee Organization, of
which I feel I should be a member. Population data come from the UN Population
Division. Observations for Yugoslavia in 1990 and 1991 are imputed manually.
The observation for 1990 comes from a UN Population Division report. The 1991
observation comes from the Yugoslavian census.

The membership variable is agnostic to when a state became a member.

Observations for the People's Republic of China are broken into components of
China (Mainland), Hong Kong, and Macao. The consumption data for the People's
Republic of China are simply the sum of the \code{value} variable for those three
observations in a given year. The population variable is not; it codes the
entire of Chinese population (including Hong Kong and Macao). Use with that
in mind.

The user may want to be mindful about when 0s in the value data are actually
communicating that the entry did not exist at the time, or no longer exists.
For example, there is no independent Armenia in 1990 (and whatever imports
Armenia had are lumped into the USSR value for 1990). Likewise, the 0s for
the USSR in 1992 are communicating the USSR no longer exists that year and you
should instead look into one of the constituent republics for the information
you want. You may want to benchmark this information to some kind of state
system membership data.
