\title{Hypothetical (Fake) Data on Academic Performance}
\format{
A data frame with 10000 observations on the following 8 variables.
\describe{
\item{\code{uid}}{a numeric vector as a unique identifier for schools}
\item{\code{schooltype}}{a character vector for school type. E = elementary school. M = middle school. H = high school}
\item{\code{county}}{a character vector for the county, named after an Ohio State All-American. ``County'' incidence is weighted by how many All-American honors the Ohio State player had. It's my fake data. You make your own if you have a problem with it.}
\item{\code{community}}{a character vector for the school's community, either rural, suburban, or urban.}
\item{\code{api}}{a numeric vector vector an academic performance index for the school}
\item{\code{meals}}{a numeric vector for the percentage of school students eligible for subsidized meals}
\item{\code{colgrad}}{a numeric vector for the percentage of school parents with college degrees}
\item{\code{fullqual}}{a numeric vector for the percentage of the school with teachers that are fully qualified}
\item{\code{sbase}}{a numeric vector for some base differences between schools, patterned off the school type means for \code{api00} in the \code{apipop} data.}
\item{\code{cbase}}{a numeric vector for some base differences between counties, randomly drawn from a uniform distribution}
\item{\code{e}}{a numeric vector for random errors}

\description{
This is a hypothetical universe of schools in a given territorial unit,
patterned off the \code{apipop} data available in the \code{survey} package.

These data were generated for a blog post on my website.
