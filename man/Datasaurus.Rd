A data frame with 1,846 observations on the following 3 variables.

\description{
An illustrative exercise in never trusting the summary statistics without
 also visualizing them.
}
\details{
Data were created by Alberto Cairo to illustrate you should always
visualize your data beyond the summary statistics. These are 12 data sets,
in long form, each with a mean of \code{x} about 54.26, a mean of \code{y}
about 47.83. The standard deviation for \code{x} is about 16.76 and the
standard deviation of \code{y} is about 26.93. \code{x} and \code{y} will
correlate weakly, about -.06.
