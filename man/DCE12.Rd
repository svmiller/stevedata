\description{
A data set on domestic conflict events in 2012 as recorded by the Cross-National
 Time Series Database. Data exist for teaching about count models.
}
\details{
Conflict events data come from the Cross-National Time Series Database. I've
used these data before for published papers, but the relative opacity of a
data set for yearly purchase comes with a bit of a caveat emptor for the
important question of real-world inference.

Data on the democracy estimate and tertiary school enrollment rate come from
the Varieties of Democracy project. Population estimates come from the UN
Population Division. GDP per capita comes from the World Bank. The estimate
of land area (in square kilometers) come from the CNTS. Country name comes
from CNTS as well.
