This is a simple data set provided by Chatterjee and Price (1977, p. 108)
that serves as a known example of heteroscedasticity.

\details{
I copied these data from the \code{robustbase} package.
I just didn't want to make my students install it.
Note: I'm pretty sure "NB" was suppose to be "NE" and that
"DY" is supposed to be "KY". I made those changes.
