\description{
This is the yearly rate of gun homicides per 100,000 people in the population,
selecting on "Western" countries of interest.
}
\details{
The reported, or calculated annual crude rate of completed,
intentional homicide committed with a firearm, per 100,000 population,
in years descending.

Where a jurisdiction's published count of 'annual homicide' includes cases
of attempted (uncompleted) homicide, these figures have been disaggregated
wherever possible.

In the United States, this category is confused by inaccurate and conflicting
data published, suppressed or labeled as unreliable by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
Suppression can result in zero values where in fact homicides did occur.

Incomplete classification by local agencies can also result in a significant
proportion of events being categorized as 'unknown cause' or similar.

Before quoting these datasets, please follow the citation links for a description
of the considerable differences between them and the reasons for data suppression.

Where a rate is calculated by \code{GunPolicy.org}, a matched population estimate is also cited.
