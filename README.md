`stevedata` is an R package full of toy data sets that you may find
useful for various purposes. Namely, I’ve created probably over a
hundred toy data sets along the way, either to riff on some topic on [my
blog](http://svmiller.com/blog/), show my students something in one of
[my many classes](http://svmiller.com/teaching/), or just to entertain
myself for [spamming Twitter with my assorted
thoughts](https://twitter.com/stevenvmiller). I had stuffed a lot of
these into [`stevemisc`](https://github.com/svmiller/stevemisc), but I
want to keep that package mostly about the functions (and whatever data
are useful for showing off the functions). `stevedata` will have all my
toy data going forward.

I anticipate two sets of R users may find these data useful. First,
instructors may find these data useful for classes on a variety of
topics, but prominently quantitative methods and international
relations. Many of the toy data sets included in this R package are data
I’ve acquired or assembled to teach about topics in quantitative methods
or international relations in a reproducible way. Users should see my
Github repositories for my classes on [introduction to international
relations](https://github.com/svmiller/posc1020), [quantitative methods
in political science](https://github.com/svmiller/posc3410), and
[foundations of social science research for public
policy](https://github.com/svmiller/post8000) to see how I’ve used these
data (or development versions of them). Topics here are diverse,
including (but not limited to) [carbon dioxide emissions over 800,000
years](https://github.com/svmiller/stevedata/blob/master/man/co2emissions.Rd)
(as an illustration of climate change), [coffee
prices](https://github.com/svmiller/stevedata/blob/master/man/coffee_price.Rd)
(as an illustration of the worsening [terms of
trade](https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Global_economics/Terms_of_trade.html#:~:text=A%20worsening%20terms%20of%20trade,the%20price%20of%20manufactured%20goods.)),
[the justifiability of
bribe-taking](https://github.com/svmiller/stevedata/blob/master/man/wvs_justifbribe.Rd)
(as an illustration of information-poor and discrete variables that a
researcher may be tempted to treat as drawn from a normal distribution),
the canonical case of [illiteracy rates in the 1930 U.S.
Census](https://github.com/svmiller/stevedata/blob/master/man/illiteracy30.Rd)
(as an illustration of an [ecological
fallacy](https://www.britannica.com/science/ecological-fallacy)), and
many, many more topics.

Second, my students in these classes (but especially my methods classes)
should find this R package useful. I will also be having my methods
students (undergraduate and graduate) download this package to work
through problem sets in the R programming language. It’d be a benefit to
them (and less hassle/headache for myself) to have my students download
this package from CRAN rather than work through potential
[`curl`](https://curl.se) issues by installing through Github.

In almost all instances, each data set has an underlying code/script
that generates them. These are in a `data-raw` directory that is not
included in the Github repository or the R package. However, I invite
users to reach out with questions about the data if they have them.

## Installation

This package is now on CRAN. You can download it as you would any other
R package.

``` r
install.packages("stevedata")
```

You can also install the development version of `stevedata` from Github
via the `devtools` package. I suppose using the `remotes` package would
work as well.

``` r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/stevedata")
```

## Usage

The data set already has a lot to offer those who might be curious about
its contents. You can do this to see what is in it.

``` r
data(package = "stevedata")
```

The ensuing output will look like this.
