stevedata 0.4.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The newest release will have some new and updated data sets. These include:

- `anes_partytherms`: a data frame on thermometer ratings for the Democratic party, Republican party, and thermometer indices of both in the ANES (1978-2012)
- `turnips`: a data frame on turnip prices in Animal Crossing. This will be here, likely, as long as I can commit to doing this.

Examples may have been updated for greater clarity, especially as this release comes with an accompanying site generated by `{pkgdown}`. The vignette has been updated as well to account for this.

The release of this package was accelerated by a note from Brian Ripley that R users should anticipate decreased support for direct links by FTP in their preferred web browsers. Accordingly, these links should be changed or scrubbed. This concerned the `co2emissions` data and documentation. I removed those FTP links. There were no http:// or https:// corollaries. However, the bibliography is still sufficiently informative.

stevedata 0.3.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The newest release adds a few variables to `election_turnout` (with the idea of ultimately phasing out this data set). More importantly, CRAN flagged this as a package with unnecessarily large "LazyData" data sets. It makes the change implored by Brian Ripley in the DESCRIPTION file.

- Updating `Presidents` because Trump's tenure is mercifully over.


stevedata 0.2.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------
