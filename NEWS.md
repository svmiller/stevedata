The release of this package was accelerated by a note from Brian Ripley that R users should anticipate decreased support for direct links by FTP in their preferred web browsers. Accordingly, these links should be changed or scrubbed. This concerned the `co2emissions` data and documentation. I removed those FTP links. There were no http:// or https:// corollaries. However, the bibliography is still sufficiently informative.

# stevedata 0.3.1
